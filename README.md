In this video we have presented a demonstration of how the thermocouple works. 
The two wires (made of different materials) are interlinked with each other. 
On one end the temperature is the same as the room temperature whereas the other end is heated by a gas cylinder 
whose temperature can go up to 3600 Fahrenheit degrees. Due to the movement of electrons a voltage (therefore a current)
is generated, which we can clearly see on the multimeter display.
